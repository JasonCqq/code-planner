## Learning Experience
This project/app was created to not only learn Angular along with a SQL database to compare the difference
<br />
from React and MongoDB, but also, I wanted to create something I could use. Overall, I enjoyed using Angular
<br />
more than React due to the structure that Angular provides, although React is much easier to get going with.
<br />
I also preferred PostgreSQL over MongoDB as a database. PostgreSQL felt more fluid especially with the relational data.
<br />
Overall, I'm happy with the outcome of the app. I will continue to update, optimize, and push out new features for the site.
